# Text‚Äëto‚ÄëTest üöÄ

Generate end‚Äëto‚Äëend Playwright tests from natural‚Äëlanguage scenarios. The backend drives a real browser, analyzes the UI via a vision model, plans actions, selects robust locators, performs steps, and finally emits runnable JS tests.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

```
text-to-test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/                   # FastAPI backend + core engine
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/infrastructure/    # OpenAI/DeepSeek clients, settings
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/services/          # Orchestrator, planners, DOM extractor, performer
‚îÇ  
```

## Key Capabilities ‚ú®

- Text LLM provider switch: OpenAI or DeepSeek R1 (reasoner) for selector planning 
- Real browser execution with Playwright to validate each step
- Emits complete Playwright JS tests with verified selectors

## Requirements üì¶

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js (for Playwright runtime if needed)
- Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install --with-deps`
- OpenAI API key (for vision) and optionally DeepSeek API key (for text tasks)

## Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

1) Clone and enter repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/didemyaniktepe/text-to-test.git
cd text-to-test
```

2) Backend env and deps (pyproject.toml / Poetry)
```bash
cd backend
# If Poetry is not installed: curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
poetry install
poetry run playwright install --with-deps
```

3) Playwright browsers (once)
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

4) Configure environment in `.env` üîê
```env
# Provider for text-only tasks (selector planning, codegen): openai or deepseek
OPENAI_PROVIDER=deepseek
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-openai-...
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# DeepSeek (used when OPENAI_PROVIDER=deepseek)
OPENAI_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-deepseek-...
OPENAI_DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-reasoner
OPENAI_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com

# Vision is always OpenAI with a vision-capable model
OPENAI_VISION_PROVIDER=openai
OPENAI_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

Notes:
- Vision pipeline requires an image‚Äëcapable model; `gpt-4o` is used by default.
- If `OPENAI_PROVIDER=deepseek`, only text tasks are routed to DeepSeek; vision stays on OpenAI.

## Run Backend ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```bash
poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs

## How It Works (Architecture) üß≠

- Orchestrator: `TestGeneratorService` runs an iteration loop:
  - Extract current DOM + screenshot (`DOMExtractorService`)
  - Plan next step from scenario + UI (`TestStepPlanner` ‚Üí `VisionAnalysisClient` with `gpt-4o`)
  - Choose a robust locator and action (`ElementSelector` ‚Üí `ElementSelectorClient` via OpenAI/DeepSeek)
  - Perform the action in browser (`ActionPerformer`/Playwright); collect failures for retries
  - Accumulate verified steps, then generate code (`TestCodeGeneratorClient`)


## Usage (Programmatic) üõ†Ô∏è

Call the service from an endpoint or script with a scenario and URL. The service returns Playwright JS code. See `TestGeneratorService.generate()` for an end‚Äëto‚Äëend example.

## Troubleshooting üß©

- 400 invalid content type (image_url): Ensure vision model is image‚Äëcapable and vision provider is OpenAI (`OPENAI_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o`).
- Selector not found: The system records `failed_attempts` and retries with DOM context; check logs for the chosen selector and page state.
